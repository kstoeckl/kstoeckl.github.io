- *Koszul Operads Governing Props and Wheeled Props*, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08718)
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we construct groupoid coloured operads governing props and wheeled props, and show they are Koszul. This is accomplished by new biased definitions for (wheeled) props, and an extension of the theory of Groebner bases for operads to apply to groupoid coloured operads. Using the Koszul machine, we define homotopy (wheeled) props, and show they are not formed by polytope based models. Finally, using homotopy transfer theory, we construct Massey products for (wheeled) props, show these products characterise the formality of these structures, and re-obtain a theorem of Mac Lane on the existence of higher homotopies of (co)commutative Hopf algebras.</details>

Hi,

I'm a PhD student at the University of Melbourne supervised by [Marcy Robertson](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/) and co-supervised by [Jan de Gier](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/jan-de-gier/). I've been looking at techniques for proving that operadic structures are Koszul. Informally, operadic structures are graph like structures with further data pasted on top and showing that these structures are Koszul provides a means to study the homotopy of algebras over these operadic structures. 

If you want to get in touch my email is kstoeckl@student.unimelb.edu.au

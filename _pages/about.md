Hi,

I'm a PhD student at the University of Melbourne supervised by [Marcy Robertson](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/) and co-supervised by [Jan de Gier](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/jan-de-gier/). I've thus far mostly been looking at techniques for proving that operadic structures are Koszul. In particular, those based on Groebner bases and rewriting methods. In addition, I've also been thinking about polytopes and their relation to homotopy operadic structures.

If you want to get in touch my email is kstoeckl@student.unimelb.edu.au

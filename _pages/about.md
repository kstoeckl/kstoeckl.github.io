Hi,

I'm a PhD student at the University of Melbourne (with expected completion 2024), supervised by [Marcy Robertson](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/). My research interests lie in the study of (homotopy) operadic structures and their algebras, particularly via combinatorial techniques.

What is an [operad](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-operad-part-1), and where do [I fit in](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/ResearchStatement.pdf)?

If you want to get in touch my email is kstoeckl@student.unimelb.edu.au

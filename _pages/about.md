Hi,

I'm a PhD student at the University of Melbourne supervised by [Marcy Robertson](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/) and co-supervised by [Jan de Gier](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/jan-de-gier/). Currently I'm looking at extending the theory of [Groebner basis for operads](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4069) to properads and props. Informally, operadic structures are graph like structures with further data pasted on top, and Groebner basis provide a minimal description of these structures.

If you want to get in touch my email is kstoeckl@student.unimelb.edu.au

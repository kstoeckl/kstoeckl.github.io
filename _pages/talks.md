Here is a subset of the talks I've given recently.

- *Relating Diagonals of the Permutahedra*, [GT Algebraic Combinatorics Day](https://jagtcombalg.sciencesconf.org/), 4th July 2023, 25 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2023/GTAlgebraicCombinatorics.pdf)
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The study of cellular approximations to the diagonal of polytopes has a long history, mostly owing to applications in homotopy theory. In this talk, we will focus on a well known polytope, the permutahedra.  We shall briefly review existing theory and some new enumerative results, before seeking to relate two distinct formulae for cellular operadic diagonals of the permutahedra. Through combinatorial means, we will show that the Saneblidze—Umble diagonal (2004), and Laplante-Anfossi diagonal (2022), are the only such diagonals. Furthermore, we shall relate them via a simple isomorphism. This talk is based on ongoing joint work with Berenice Delcroix-Oger, Matthieu Josuat-Verges, Guillaume Laplante-Anfossi and Vincent Pilaud. </details>

- *Homotopy Wheeled Props*, [Homotopy Theory in Trondheim](https://folk.ntnu.no/runegha/htpyintrd.html), 30th June 2023, 25 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2023/HomotopyTheoryInTrondheim.pdf)
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>A prop is a free symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, and a wheeled prop is a prop with a trace. They are useful and ubiquitous structures, not only encoding bialgebras (with traces), but also having applications in knot theory and topology. In this talk, without assuming familiarity with these structures, we will present new definitions of (wheeled) props, and characterise them as algebras over Koszul groupoid coloured operads. We will outline how our proof that these operads are Koszul, using an extension of Groebner bases to groupoid coloured operads, circumvents simple obstructions to existing techniques. We will then indicate how the Koszul machine defines a homotopy (wheeled) prop and unpack what exactly this entails. Finally, we will explore homotopy transfer theory applied to these structures, obtaining consequences in formality theory, and re-obtaining a theorem of Mac Lane.</details>

- *A Koszul Operad Governing Wheeled Props*, [AustMS 2022](https://austms.org.au/event/austms-2022/), 6th December 2022, 20 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2022/AustMS2022.pdf)
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>A prop is a free symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, meaning that any morphism in a prop is of the form $x^{\otimes m}\to x^{\otimes n}$. A wheeled prop is a prop in which every object has a dual. Props and wheeled props arise naturally in the study of homotopy coherent algebraic structures, deformation theory and knot theory. It is well known that there exist discrete coloured operads (multicategories) which govern props and wheeled props. This arises from the underlying fact that trees can be used to form disconnected graphs possibly with directed cycles. In this talk we'll discuss a groupoid coloured operad governing wheeled props, and prove that this operad is Koszul. One consequence of our construction is that we can give a definition of an infinity wheeled prop, which is to wheeled props as infinity categories are to categories.</details>

- *A Koszul Operad Governing Wheeled Props*, [Categories and Companions Symposium 2022](https://categories-and-companions.github.io/), 23rd September 2022, 20 mins, [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNqg3Wae_QI&ab_channel=CategoriesandCompanionsSymposium-2022), [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2022/CaCS2022.pdf)

- *Quadratic Presentations of Operads Governing Operadic Structures*, [University of Melbourne Topology Seminar](https://topology.science.unimelb.edu.au/topsem/), 9th May 2022, 30 mins, 
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>There exist coloured operads whose algebras are other operadic structures such as modular operads, wheeled properads and props. In “Massey Products for Graph Homology”, Ben Ward gives a quadratic presentation of a groupoid coloured operad whose algebras are modular operads and shows this operad is Koszul. In this talk we’ll informally discuss what operads governing operadic structures look like, how we can get nice presentations of these operads using ideas of Ward, and some consequences.</details>

- *Mini-series on Groebner Bases for Operads*, [Weekly Student Seminar](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/students.html), 9th-16th February 2022, 
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>An informal mini-series consisting of two one hour sessions where we unpacked what it means for an operad to have a Groebner basis. We focused in particular on how we can use Groebner bases as a tool to prove operads are Koszul.</details>

- *Groebner Bases for Operads Cannot be Generalised to Wheeled Structures*, [Australian Kittens 2021](http://www.marcyrobertson.com/australian-kittens--an-ecr-conference.html), 2nd December 2021, 20 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2021/GBforWheeledStructsCounterExample.pdf), 
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The theory of Groebner basis for operadic structures provides an algorithmic method of proving that certain structures are Koszul. First introduced for operads by Dotsenko and Khoroshkin, the theory has recently been generalised to coloured operads by Kharitonov and Khoroshkin. In this talk we will discuss the existing theory, some further possible generalisations, and present a simple counter example showing the theory cannot be generalised to wheeled operads, properads and props.</details>

- *Groebner Bases for Operads Cannot be Generalised to Wheeled Structures*, [Australian Kittens 2021](http://www.marcyrobertson.com/australian-kittens--an-ecr-conference.html), [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2021/GBforWheeledStructsCounterExample.pdf)<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The theory of Groebner basis for operadic structures provides an algorithmic method of proving that certain structures are Koszul. First introduced for operads by Dotsenko and Khoroshkin, the theory has recently been generalised to coloured operads by Kharitonov and Khoroshkin. In this talk we will discuss the existing theory, some further possible generalisations, and present a simple counter example showing the theory cannot be generalised to wheeled operads, properads and props.</details>

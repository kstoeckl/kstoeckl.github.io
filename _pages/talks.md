- *A Koszul Operad Governing Wheeled Props*, [Categories and Companions Symposium 2022](https://categories-and-companions.github.io/), 23rd September 2022, 20 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2022/CaCS2022.pdf), <details>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>

	A prop is a free symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, meaning that any morphism in a prop is of the form $x^{\otimes m}\to x^{\otimes n}$. A wheeled prop is a prop in which every object has a dual. Props and wheeled props arise naturally in the study of homotopy coherent algebraic structures, deformation theory and knot theory. It is well known that there exist discrete coloured operads (multicategories) which govern props and wheeled props. This arises from the underlying fact that trees can be used to form disconnected graphs possibly with directed cycles. In this talk we'll discuss a groupoid coloured operad governing wheeled props, and prove that this operad is Koszul. One consequence of our construction is that we can give a definition of an infinity wheeled prop, which is to wheeled props as infinity categories are to categories.

- *Quadratic Presentations of Operads Governing Operadic Structures*, [University of Melbourne Topology Seminar](https://topology.science.unimelb.edu.au/topsem/), 9th May 2022, 30 mins, <details>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>

	There exist coloured operads whose algebras are other operadic structures such as modular operads, wheeled properads and props. In “Massey Products for Graph Homology”, Ben Ward gives a quadratic presentation of a groupoid coloured operad whose algebras are modular operads and shows this operad is Koszul. In this talk we’ll informally discuss what operads governing operadic structures look like, how we can get nice presentations of these operads using ideas of Ward, and some consequences.

- *Mini-series on Groeber Bases for Operads*, [Weekly Student Seminar](https://www.marcyrobertson.com/students.html), 9th-16th February 2022, <details>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>

	An informal mini-series consisting of two one hour sessions where we unpacked what it means for an operad to have a Groebner basis. We focused in particular on how we can use Groebner bases as a tool to prove operads are Koszul.

- *Groebner Bases for Operads Cannot be Generalised to Wheeled Structures*, [Australian Kittens 2021](http://www.marcyrobertson.com/australian-kittens--an-ecr-conference.html), 2nd December 2021, 20 mins, [slides](https://kstoeckl.github.io/files/talks/2021/GBforWheeledStructsCounterExample.pdf), <details>
	<summary>Abstract</summary>

	The theory of Groebner basis for operadic structures provides an algorithmic method of proving that certain structures are Koszul. First introduced for operads by Dotsenko and Khoroshkin, the theory has recently been generalised to coloured operads by Kharitonov and Khoroshkin. In this talk we will discuss the existing theory, some further possible generalisations, and present a simple counter example showing the theory cannot be generalised to wheeled operads, properads and props.
